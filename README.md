# telegram_meme_sender

It's a pretty simple application for sending pictures, gifs and videos periodically to your channel. 
Just build the binary from golang sources code, input your bot parameters into config.json, and period time (minutes). You have to put your media files on files directory in the same directory where you run your binary.

1. Build  
*go build telegramSender.go*

2. Run  
*./telegramSender*
